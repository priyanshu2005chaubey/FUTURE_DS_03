COLLEGE EVENT FEEDBACK ANALYSIS

This project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected from campus events such as workshops, tech fests, and seminars. Using Python and data science techniques, I processed both numerical ratings and open-ended comments to extract actionable insights aimed at improving future events.

âœ… Project Overview

Feedback forms often collect valuable information, but itâ€™s not always structured or easy to interpret. In this project, I worked with real-world survey data to:

Clean and preprocess feedback datasets

Analyze event ratings and satisfaction trends

Perform sentiment analysis on textual feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Visualize results using graphs and word clouds

Provide recommendations based on the findings

âœ… Key Features

âœ” Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handled missing data and ensured numeric ratings were ready for analysis.

âœ” Ratings Analysis
Explored patterns in student satisfaction using summary statistics and bar charts.

âœ” Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
Applied TextBlob to classify feedback into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, enabling deeper understanding of student opinions.

âœ” Data Visualization
Used matplotlib and WordCloud to create charts and graphical representations of trends and sentiments.

âœ” Actionable Insights
Identified areas where events could be improved and provided recommendations to organizers based on both ratings and feedback text.

âœ… Technologies Used

Python â€“ Programming language

Google Colab â€“ Cloud-based coding environment

pandas â€“ Data manipulation

matplotlib â€“ Data visualization

TextBlob â€“ Sentiment analysis (NLP)

WordCloud â€“ Visual representation of common feedback terms

âœ… Dataset Information

Two datasets were used in this project:

Student Satisfaction Survey â€“ Contains ratings on different aspects of events (e.g., course relevance, support).

Student Feedback â€“ Contains open-ended responses where students shared their thoughts and concerns.

âœ… What I Learned

âœ” How to preprocess and clean real-world survey data
âœ” Techniques to analyze both structured and unstructured data
âœ” Application of sentiment analysis to understand textual feedback
âœ” How to visualize findings to communicate results effectively
âœ” Problem-solving in handling datasets and deriving insights

âœ… Next Steps / Improvements

âœ” Integrate more advanced NLP techniques like topic modeling
âœ” Automate reporting dashboards for event organizers
âœ” Expand to include demographic analysis for targeted improvements
